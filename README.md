## Description and links to the datasets used
The aim of this project is to determine the best neighborhood for families to live in based on a combination of factors including crime rate, student enrollment, and housing prices. By analyzing data from multiple sources, we will identify neighborhoods that provide a safe environment, quality education opportunities, and affordable housing options. Our analysis will provide valuable insights and information that can help families make informed decisions about where to live and raise their children. This project will involve collecting and cleaning data from various sources, conducting statistical analysis, and visualizing our findings using Python libraries. We hope that the results of our project will help families find the best neighborhood to raise their family.
