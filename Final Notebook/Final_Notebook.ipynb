    "Our goal is to find the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh for families to live in. Factors such as crime rates, quality of education, and housing prices all play a significant role in this decision-making process. Therefore, it is important to provide families with reliable and informative data that can help them make informed decisions about where to live and raise their children. This project aims to analyze various sources of data and identify the best neighborhoods for families based on a combination of these factors. Through statistical analysis and data visualization using Python libraries, we will provide insights into the safest neighborhoods with quality education opportunities and affordable housing options. This project will be of great benefit to families looking for a new home, as it will help them make an informed decision and find the ideal neighborhood to raise their family."
